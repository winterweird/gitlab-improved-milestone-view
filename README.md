# Gitlab milestone support for subtasks

This extension modifies the Gitlab milestone view to group subtasks with their
respective parent tasks, if found. This makes a milestone which includes both
subtasks and parent tasks more structured and easier to understand.

In addition it highlights in-progress tasks.
